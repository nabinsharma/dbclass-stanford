Question 1: Find all pizzas that are eaten only by people younger than 24,
or that cost less than $10 everywhere they're served.

(\project_{pizza} Eats \diff \project_{pizza}(\select_{age>=24} Person \join Eats))
\union
(\project_{pizza} Serves \diff \project_{pizza} (\select_{price >= 10} Serves))


Question 2: Find the age of the oldest person (or people) who eat mushroom pizza.

\project_{age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats) \diff
(\project_{a1} \select_{a1 < a2} \rename_{a1, a2} (\project_{age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats) \cross \project_{age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats)))


Question 3: Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30.

\project_{pizzeria} Serves
\diff
\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join
((\project_{pizza} Serves) \diff (\project_{pizza}((\select_{age>'30'} Person) \join Eats))))


Question 4: Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30.

\project_{pizzeria} Serves \diff
\project_{pizzeria}(
(\project_{pizzeria} Serves) \cross (\project_{pizza}(\select_{age>'30'}Person \join Eats))
\diff
\project_{pizzeria,pizza} ((\select_{age>'30'} Person \join Eats) \join Serves))
